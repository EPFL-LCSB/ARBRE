# The ARBRE does 2 things:
# I: Pathway Search (put "p" to parameter pathways_or_networkexp)
# II: Network expansion (put "n" to parameter pathways_or_networkexp)

# I:
# Stages of the algorithm to execute pathway search
# Avoid executing same stage twice if the consecutive stage failed
# stage 1 : pathway search
# stage 2 : reaction assignment
# stage 3 : enzyme assignment
# stage 4 : pathways ranking
# stage 5 : visualization

# Pathway score calculation
# pathway score=0.25× BR+0.25× CAR+0.25×(shortest PL)/PL+0.25× KR
# BR - average BridgIT score
# CAR - average CAR
# PL - pathway length
# KR - percent of known reactions
# weight for each of the parameters
weight_BR|0.25
weight_CAR|0.25
weight_PL|0.25
